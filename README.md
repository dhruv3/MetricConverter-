# MetricConverter-

Everyday, I read articles on Web regarding technology, sports and world news. Often encounter quantities given in Metric unit in these articles. Converting these units mentally into ones I use is not an easy task. To solve this problem I decided to create Chrome extension.

Using Metric Converter:

I designed and coded Metric Converter plugin works as follow:

User selects or highlights quantity it wants to converts
User then clicks on the Convert! button
Value in imperial unit is displayed inside the textarea.
As of this moment following conversions are supported:

Pounds (lbs) to Kilograms
Miles to Kilometers
Miles per hour to Kilometers per Hour
Foot/Feet to Meters
Fahrenheit to Celsius
Inch to cm
